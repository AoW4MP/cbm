                <h3>Important features include:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Research buildings: are now much more expensive. Think about if your economy can afford going
                        for those.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Stability: positive stability now increases gold and mana and income (in addition to default
                        food, production and draft). Don’t forget to build taverns and bathhouses for your people!
                        (Don’t worry Dark players, you get even stronger bonuses for NEGATIVE (!!!) stability).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Cultural unit unlock: you now longer need higher levels of town hall to produce T2/3 cultural
                        units. Instead you need draft buildings - Workshop for T2 and Blacksmith for T3. Isn’t that
                        extra draft quite nice if you’re gunning for a better army?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Town hall economy: since town halls stopped unlocking new units, they decided to help build up
                        your empire! They produce knowledge and more gold depending on the level. Raise your population
                        so you unlock and boost those economic powerhouses!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Athletics or mounts: those form traits are much cheaper and provide much-needed overland
                        movement boost for your armies. Strongly consider grabbing either of those.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        City defense: defensive structures are stronger and unlock earlier. If you fear being rushed by
                        powerful enemy - turn your cities into impregnable fortresses by building walls and defensive
                        towers. Hide behind those walls and turn the tide of the battle!
                    </li>
